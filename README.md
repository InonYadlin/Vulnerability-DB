to run, open 2 seperate terminal
in one, open the 'frontend' folder and run 'npm start', 
if you're getting the following error: " 'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file. "
run the command: 'npm install react-scripts --save'
in the second terminal, open the 'backend' folder and run 'python app.py'.
